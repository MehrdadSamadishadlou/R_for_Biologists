Join me for an introductory course on applying R programming for life science research. In this 10-session course starting Aban 24th, we will cover the fundamentals of R along with key techniques for handling, visualizing, and analyzing biological data. 
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
R is rapidly becoming an essential tool for life scientists. This course will introduce you to the capabilities of the R language and environment. We'll start with R basics like <b>data structures and programming constructs</b>. Then we'll explore crucial tasks like <b>importing, wrangling, and visualizing datasets</b>. We’ll also cover <b>integrating R into statistics and bioinformatics workflows, including differential expression analysis, gene set enrichment, and more</b>.
</p>

Each session will feature hands-on activities to apply what you learn. Our first meeting will be an overview of the course scope and schedule. Afterwards, we will agree on consistent meeting times that work for the group. All materials, including code examples, exercises, and project ideas, will be available on our course website. 
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
Whether you are new to programming or want to expand your skills, this course will equip you with R abilities to advance your research. By the end, you’ll be able to use R to effectively manage, interpret, and present biological data. I look forward to fostering an interactive learning community for computational abilities relevant to life science!
