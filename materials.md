An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, is a software application that provides a comprehensive environment for programmers to write, edit, and debug code. RStudio is a popular and powerful IDE developed for R by Posit. RStudio makes using R much easier, especially for beginners. The R console and environment are seamlessly integrated into RStudio so you can run R code and see plots, output, and results. RStudio also comes pre-installed with packages and functions to help you be more productive with R.
