  The CRAN Admin Team will be performing system upgrades on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) from Wednesday, November 15 until Thursday, November 16, 2023 (24-25 Aban). During this time, you may experience intermittent connectivity issues or an inability to access CRAN mirrors when trying to download R and/or R packages. This is expected behavior during the upgrade window.

An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, is a software application that provides a comprehensive environment for programmers to write, edit, and debug code. RStudio is a popular and powerful IDE developed for R by Posit. RStudio makes using R much easier, especially for beginners. The R console and environment are seamlessly integrated into RStudio so you can run R code and see plots, output, and results. RStudio also comes pre-installed with packages and functions to help you be more productive with R.
