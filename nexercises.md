**Please email me your answers as a single R script file. In the script file define which question the answer is for using comments (`#`). If any question needs any explanation please add it to your script as a comment.**

Example answer:
```
# Question 1:
sum(1:100)

# Question 2:

## Exercise 1

1. Write code to calculate the sum of the first 100 integers.
2. Which of the following will always return the numeric value stored in **x**? You can try out examples and use the help system in the R console.
   1. `log(10^x)`
   2. `log10(x^10)`
   3. `log(exp(x))`
   4. `exp(log(x, base=2))`

3. Use the accessor (`$`) to extract all columns of the **murders** dataset and assign them to a variable name and after that determine their class.
4. Write a nested function that outputs the number of regions included in the region variable.
5. Load **movielens** dataset from *dslabs* package into R and answer the following questions based on this dataset:
   1. How many rows are in the dataset?
   2. How many different variables are in the dataset?
   3. What is the variable type of title?
   4. What is the variable type of genres?
   5. How many levels are in the factor genres?
  
6. Create a vector **x** of integers that starts at 12 and ends at 73. Determine the length of object **x**.
7. Create a vector containing all the positive odd numbers smaller than 100. The numbers should be in descending order.
8. Using `seq` function create a vector that contains 15 numbers with equal distance in-between 1 and 1000.
9. In **murders** dataset, access population values from the dataset and store it in a variable named **pop**. Sort the object and save it in the same object. Report the smallest population size.
10. Define the variable **i** to be the index of the smallest state. Define variable **states** to hold the states. Use the index you just defined to find the state with the smallest population.
11. Store the per 100,000 murder rate for each state in **murder_rate**. Using this variable, calculate the average murder rate in the US.
12. If the vector **x** is defined as follows: `x <- c(2, 43, 27, 96, 18)`, match the following outputs to the function that produces that output. Options include `sort(x)`, `order(x)`, and none of these:
      1. `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`
      2. `1, 5, 3, 2, 4`
      3. `18, 27, 43, 96`

13. Akbar, Sarah, Ali, and Nastaran all ran different distances in different time intervals. Their distances (in km) and times (in minutes) are as follows:
```
name <- c("Akbar", "Sarah", "Ali", "Nastaran")
distance <- c(0.8, 3.1, 2.8, 4.0)
time <- c(10, 30, 40, 50)
```
Write a line of code to convert time to hours. Then write a line of code to calculate the speed of each runner in km per hour (Speed is distance divided by time). Who was the fastest runner?



## Exercise 2

1. Using **murders** dataset, create a table, call it **my_states**, that satisfies both the conditions: it is in the Northeast or West and the murder rate is less than 1. Use `select` to show only the state name, the rate, and the rank.


Let's explore the **NHANES** data. We will be exploring blood pressure in this dataset. First, let's select a group to set the standard. We will use 20-29 year old females. Note that the category is coded with ` 20-29`, with a space in front of the 20! The AgeDecade is a categorical variable with these ages. To know if someone is female, you can look at the Gender variable.


2. Filter the **NHANES** dataset so that only ` 20-29` year old females are included and assign this new data frame to an object. Now we will compute the average and standard deviation for the subgroup we defined (` 20-29` year old females), which we will use reference for what is typical. Write a line of code to save the average and standard deviation of systolic blood pressure (BPSysAve column) as average and standard_deviation to a variable called ref.
3. Report the min and max values for the same group as in the previous exercises. Use `filter` and `summarise` connected by the pipe `%>%` again. The functions min and max can be used to get the values you want.
4. Calculate the average and standard deviation of systolic blood pressure for males for each age group separately.
5. We can use group_by(AgeDecade, Gender) to group by both age decades and gender. Create a single summary table for the average and standard deviation of systolic blood pressure using group_by(AgeDecade, Gender).
6. Compute the average and standard deviation for each value of the Race1 column for males in the age decade ` 40-49`. Order the resulting table from lowest to highest average systolic blood pressure.
